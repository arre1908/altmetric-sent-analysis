We further investigated one of the marks, lysine crotonylation (Kcr), confirming that it represents an evolutionarily-conserved histone posttranslational modification. The unique structure and genomic localization of histone Kcr suggest that it is mechanistically and functionally different from histone lysine acetylation (Kac). Specifically, in both human somatic and mouse male germ cell genomes, histone Kcr marks either active promoters or potential enhancers. In male germinal cells immediately following meiosis, Kcr is enriched on sex chromosomes and specifically marks testis-specific genes, including a significant proportion of X-linked genes that escape sex chromosome inactivation in haploid cells. These results therefore dramatically extend the repertoire of histone PTM sites and designate Kcr as a specific mark of active sex chromosome-linked genes in postmeiotic male germ cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c1","authors":["Minjia Tan","Hao Luo","Sangkyu Lee","Fulai Jin","Jeong\u00a0Soo Yang","Emilie Montellier","Thierry Buchou","Zhongyi Cheng","Sophie Rousseaux","Nisha Rajagopal","Zhike Lu","Zhen Ye","Qin Zhu","Joanna Wysocka","Yang Ye","Saadi Khochbin","Bing Ren","Yingming Zhao","Tan M","Luo H","Lee S","Jin F","Yang JS","Montellier E","Buchou T","Cheng Z","Rousseaux S","Rajagopal N","Lu Z","Ye Z","Zhu Q","Wysocka J","Ye Y","Khochbin S","Ren B","Zhao Y"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cell.2011.08.008","endpage":"1028","first_seen_on":"2011-09-16T09:21:04+00:00","funders":["nci"],"isbns":[],"issns":["00928674"],"issue":"6","journal":"Cell","last_mentioned_on":1477675275,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/abstract\/S0092-8674(11)00891-9","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/abstract\/S0092-8674%2811%2900891-9","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21925322","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cell.2011.08.008","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0092867411008919","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3176443"],"pmid":"21925322","pubdate":"2011-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Citeseer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1016","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Identification of 67 histone marks and histone lysine crotonylation as a new type of histone modification","type":"article","volume":"146","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-67-histone-marks-histone-lysine-crotonylation-new-type-histone-modification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":35.716,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":35.716},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7692463,"mean":6.6010023628272,"rank":219298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":7473196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7692463,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71119,"mean":5.78176433533,"rank":1822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":69297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71119,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8950,"mean":23.325152531009,"rank":1172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8950,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":15.780485714286,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":12,"researcher":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":12,"Scientists":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":46,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":209,"Student  > Doctoral Student":33,"Student  > Ph.
